## About Laravel News Website

This is a laravel 8 news portal website with an admin dashboard. (You can used versions from 7.3 to 8, for me I run this project with 7.3) In this news website, I have added a user comment section and users can search the news by different tags.

Admin can add many categories and upload the news through the category by user-friendly administration dashboard.

## How to install and run on your local system
